# Hello World ðŸ¤ª

## About Me
I'm an API Support Engineer based in Chicago. While I currently work in Fintech, I am a trained musician with a passion for gaming. I would love for my career to lead me to the video games industry.

As a huge fan of gaming, I spend much of my free time playing games when I'm not continuing my education. I currently game most on PS5 but the Switch and Xbox are close behind.

My next goal in my career is to become a full time web developer. I'm currently most familiar in Ruby and Javascript but I'm always open to learning new things and my next big undertaking is planned to be learning C++.

## Employment
I am currently looking for new positions as a software engineer. Remote is prefered but _opportunity_is not a lengthy visitor_â€”I would also be open to a hybrid model in Chicago for the right role. 

Please feel free to check out my [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/cory-davis-026076115/) for my full employment history and ways to get in touch with me! You can also check out my portfolio at [CJGlitter.com](https://cjglitter.com)
