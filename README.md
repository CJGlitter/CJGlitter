# Hello World ðŸ¤ª

## About Me
I'm a Web SDK Engineer based in Chicago. While I currently work in Fintech, I am a trained musician with a passion for gaming. I would love for my career to lead me to the video games industry.

As a huge fan of gaming, I spend much of my free time playing games when I'm not continuing my education. I currently game most on PS5 but the Switch and Xbox are close behind.

My next goal in my career is to become a full time web developer. I'm currently most familiar in Ruby and Javascript but I'm always open to learning new things and my next big undertaking is planned to be learning C++.

## Employment
While I am happily employed and not actively looking for new positions, _opportunity is not a lengthy visitor_â€”I'm always open to hearing about new exciting opportunities..
